# Car Sales


This dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in Ukraine. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation. We look at this data as a subset from all Ukrainian car fleet.

## Content
Dataset contains 9576 rows and 10 variables with essential meanings:

- car: manufacturer brand
- price: seller’s price in advertisement (in USD)
- body: car body type
- mileage: as mentioned in advertisement (‘000 Km)
- engV: rounded engine volume (‘000 cubic cm)
- engType: type of fuel (“Other” in this case should be treated as NA)
- registration: whether car registered in Ukraine or not
- year: year of production
- model: specific model name
- drive: drive type


## EDA 


__Exploratory Data Ananlysis__ is a way of visualizing, summarizing and interpreting the information that is hidden in rows and column format.

It performs to define and refine our important features variable selection, that will be used in our model.

__EDA is executed majorly by__ -
- Uni-variate visualization
- Bi-variate visualization 
- Multivariate Visualization 
- Dimensionality reduction



We initially make several __hypothesis__ by looking at the data before we hit the modelling. Tts quite a good practice cause that will engage you more with EDA part. 

EDA helps you in __confirming and validating the hypothesis__ you make. And from here you start your feature engineering part and take a flight to machine learning modelling.

Here, we will explore the power of EDA using the car sales dataset. The dataset is on cars and its features.

The notebook here gives you more insights on how various graphs can be used to visualize data and give it interpretation.
