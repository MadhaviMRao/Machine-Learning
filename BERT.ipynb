Goals can be explicitly defined, or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similarly to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[59] Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[60] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.[61]\\n',\n",

These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"combinatorial explosion\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.[63][64] For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.[65]']"

The central bank is looking into offering banks liquidity over a 2-year or even 3-year horizon, the sources said, aiming to free up the increasingly blocked interbank money market and give banks more leeway to buy and hold sovereign bonds. To date, the longest term it has offered funds is one year. As the sovereign debt crisis has worsened, the ECB has been coming under increasing pressure to intervene on a larger scale by buying state bonds but is reluctant to make such a commitment. It does, however, have the freedom to lend banks trillions of euros and could use this firepower to indirectly support governments trying to issue debt. The ECB has flagged the possibility of longer-term loans to banks, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a move that could be aimed at gauging their interest ahead of a launch. The possibility of lending over a longer time horizon was raised at a meeting last week between the ECB and a group of banks including Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley, according to one person familiar with the matter. \"What was said was that they would be prepared to offer two or three years LTRO (lending operations),\" that person said. \"The question (for the ECB) is whether banks would be interested in it. It could be seen as a stigma if a bank was using 2 or 3-year financing with the ECB. It might not get enough take-up to make a difference.\" Another source said the ECB was looking at the possibility of providing liquidity over a similar time horizon but by giving a series of shorter-term loans with the pledge to keep this line of credit open for up to three years. A third official familiar with the matter said: \"It\\'s being discussed ... But there is no decision yet.\" The ECB first introduced extra-long 12-month liquidity tenders in June 2009. Last month, it rewewed offers to lend banks one-year funding in two operations this year -- a 12-month longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) in October and a 13-month operation in December. There has, however, only been lukewarm interest, suggesting that more ECB cash may not be the answer to a creeping credit freeze. Interbank markets remain tight, with banks worried about the health of their peers and also holding back cash as they face the prospect of having to set aside funds to cover potential losses on their sovereign debt holdings. International demands that they raise their capital base have exacerbated the problem. This nervousness was highlighted on Tuesday when euro zone banks\\' demand for ECB funding surged to a two-year high, as fast spreading sovereign debt worries left lending markets virtually frozen and the ECB as the only source of funding for many institutions. ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said earlier this week regulators must ensure banks take account of the riskiness of government bonds they own, adding to pressure on banks to set aside more capital to cover such losses. By offering banks liquidity for an ultra-long period of two or three years, the ECB could help to reinforce confidence in banks and also do the same for rocky sovereign debt markets. \"To the extent that you are improving the situation for banks, you are improving the situation for a major potential purchaser for sovereign debt,\" said one banker. \"They will know that they can refinance with the bank (ECB).\" One senior executive from a European bank, speaking anonymously, said he favored an extension of the terms under which the ECB lends to banks. \"Now, it\\'s 13 months and if we could go to 24 months, that would be better. Thirty six months would be better still but then we are at the point of medium-term financing.\" (Editing by Mike Peacock)'], ['-- Euro banks borrow less than expected from ECB\\n', '-- \\n', '-- Wed Jun 30, 2010 8:04am EDT\\n', '-- http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/30/us-ecb-liquidity-idUSTRE65T2ES20100630\\n', '\\n', ' \\n', '\\n', ' FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Banks borrowed less than expected from the European Central Bank in a key funding operation on Wednesday, easing fears about how they would cope with repaying close to half a trillion euros in emergency loans on Thursday. \\n', '\\n', ' The relatively low take-up helps to ease concerns about bank finances which have rocked stock and debt markets this week, but also raises the risk of market interest rates ticking higher as liquidity supplies may recede.

That will help Irish banks, which are major holders of their country\\'s debt, continue to borrow in ECB operations if Ireland\\'s bonds are downgraded further. Last year the ECB took a similar step to aid Greek banks. Ireland\\'s banks are heavily dependent on ECB funding, in the form of short-term loans of up to three months, because other euro zone banks refuse to lend to them in open markets. On top of the 85 billion euros which they borrowed from the ECB in February, Irish banks took a record 70 billion euros in emergency funding from the Irish central bank. But while the ECB suspended collateral requirements, it did not proceed with broader plans to establish a new facility that would provide medium-term funding to Irish banks and potentially banks from other weak euro zone states in future. This facility, by providing loans with longer tenors than ECB money market loans, might be cheaper for the banks. It would also relieve the Irish central bank of a burden by taking the place of its emergency aid. The idea for the facility had been broadly welcomed by financial markets, where it was seen as an important tool in the euro zone\\'s fight against the debt crises in weaker economies. DISAGREEMENTS A euro zone central bank source had told Reuters last week that the ECB was close to finalizing plans for the facility. But official euro zone sources said on Thursday that the ECB would not announce the plans because of internal disagreements within the central bank\\'s Governing Council. \"There will not be a formal structure through which medium-term funding will flow either from the central bank or from one of the European funds that are now being put in place,\" Ireland\\'s Finance Minister Michael Noonan said. \"But there is assurance from the European Central Bank that there will be a medium-term flow of money which underpins the restructuring and will continue into future years,\" he added. The news that the ECB would not announce the new facility hit the euro slightly on Thursday, though full financial market reaction will not be clear until European markets reopen on Friday. Ireland\\'s central bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, suggested there was little hope of the new ECB facility being created in the near term. \"I don\\'t see any prospect of anything imminent on the cards,\" he told a news conference. Two sources with knowledge of the ECB\\'s discussions said there had been substantial internal opposition to the plans for the new facility by some of the bank\\'s policymakers. \"They underestimated the resistance to the idea in the Governing Council. There has been a push back...There will be another week or two of uncertainty,\" one of the sources said. \"This is a political negotiation with high stakes.

There is a risk that it could be challenged in court for being at odds with the European Treaty that covers the operation of the euro zone. Since Ireland\\'s banks are now almost completely state-owned, the facility could potentially be seen as breaking restrictions on the financing of governments. Dutch central bank governor Nout Wellink on Thursday indicated he wanted the Irish government and perhaps other euro zone governments to do more to solve the banking problem, not the ECB. The Irish banking sector \"has become a very big black hole\", he told Dutch public broadcaster NOS. \"We (Europe) will take care of the bridging facility but the Irish will have to solve it.

Banks have already taken more funds from the ECB than ever before and risk becoming dependent on those. Italian banks had taken more than 200 billion euros in central bank funds by January, and those in Spain and France were not far behind.

The strategy has, however, sucked much of the heat out of the euro zone crisis and given governments time to work out sustainable budget and growth policies for affected countries on the periphery of the bloc. \"With the ECB\\'s supporting measures time is being won,\" said Michael Kemmer, managing director of Germany\\'s BdB banking association. \"But these measures can neither replace a functioning interbanking market nor solve the debt crisis.\" Ewald Nowotny, a member of ECB\\'s 23-man Governing Council, said on Tuesday the bank should think about an exit strategy after its massive cash injections. Rather than a simple flat rate, the 3-year funds were offered at an interest rate averaging the interest rate in its main one-week refi operations over the next three years. That rate is currently at a record low of 1.0 percent. Banks have the option of paying back all or parts of the loans at any time after one year. Financial markets are watching to see how effectively governments use the time the ECB has given them to deliver growth and sustainable budgets. \"Without growth, the LTROs are a bridge to nowhere,\" said Andrew Bosomworth, senior portfolio manager at PIMCO.

Goals can be explicitly defined, or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similarly to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[59] Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[60] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.[61]\\n', '\\n', 'AI often revolves around the use of algorithms.

BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is looking at extending the term of loans it offers banks to 2 or even 3 years to try to prevent the euro zone crisis precipitating a credit crunch that chokes the bloc\\'s economy, people familiar with the matter say.The ECB is examining this unprecedented possibility as intensifying fears about the euro zone succumbing to its debt crisis hurt the interbank money market, with banks scaling down the list of peers to which they are ready to lend. The central bank is looking into offering banks liquidity over a 2-year or even 3-year horizon, the sources said, aiming to free up the increasingly blocked interbank money market and give banks more leeway to buy and hold sovereign bonds. To date, the longest term it has offered funds is one year. As the sovereign debt crisis has worsened, the ECB has been coming under increasing pressure to intervene on a larger scale by buying state bonds but is reluctant to make such a commitment. It does, however, have the freedom to lend banks trillions of euros and could use this firepower to indirectly support governments trying to issue debt. The ECB has flagged the possibility of longer-term loans to banks, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a move that could be aimed at gauging their interest ahead of a launch. The possibility of lending over a longer time horizon was raised at a meeting last week between the ECB and a group of banks including Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley, according to one person familiar with the matter. \"What was said was that they would be prepared to offer two or three years LTRO (lending operations),\" that person said. \"The question (for the ECB) is whether banks would be interested in it. It could be seen as a stigma if a bank was using 2 or 3-year financing with the ECB. It might not get enough take-up to make a difference.\" Another source said the ECB was looking at the possibility of providing liquidity over a similar time horizon but by giving a series of shorter-term loans with the pledge to keep this line of credit open for up to three years. A third official familiar with the matter said: \"It\\'s being discussed ... But there is no decision yet.\" The ECB first introduced extra-long 12-month liquidity tenders in June 2009. Last month, it rewewed offers to lend banks one-year funding in two operations this year -- a 12-month longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) in October and a 13-month operation in December. There has, however, only been lukewarm interest, suggesting that more ECB cash may not be the answer to a creeping credit freeze. Interbank markets remain tight, with banks worried about the health of their peers and also holding back cash as they face the prospect of having to set aside funds to cover potential losses on their sovereign debt holdings. International demands that they raise their capital base have exacerbated the problem. This nervousness was highlighted on Tuesday when euro zone banks\\' demand for ECB funding surged to a two-year high, as fast spreading sovereign debt worries left lending markets virtually frozen and the ECB as the only source of funding for many institutions. ECB Governing Council member Luc Coene said earlier this week regulators must ensure banks take account of the riskiness of government bonds they own, adding to pressure on banks to set aside more capital to cover such losses. By offering banks liquidity for an ultra-long period of two or three years, the ECB could help to reinforce confidence in banks and also do the same for rocky sovereign debt markets. \"To the extent that you are improving the situation for banks, you are improving the situation for a major potential purchaser for sovereign debt,\" said one banker. \"They will know that they can refinance with the bank (ECB).\" One senior executive from a European bank, speaking anonymously, said he favored an extension of the terms under which the ECB lends to banks. \"Now, it\\'s 13 months and if we could go to 24 months, that would be better. Thirty six months would be better still but then we are at the point of medium-term financing.\" (Editing by Mike Peacock)', ' Euro banks borrow less than expected from ECB.

The strategy has, however, sucked much of the heat out of the euro zone crisis and given governments time to work out sustainable budget and growth policies for affected countries on the periphery of the bloc. \"With the ECB\\'s supporting measures time is being won,\" said Michael Kemmer, managing director of Germany\\'s BdB banking association. \"But these measures can neither replace a functioning interbanking market nor solve the debt crisis.\" Ewald Nowotny, a member of ECB\\'s 23-man Governing Council, said on Tuesday the bank should think about an exit strategy after its massive cash injections. Rather than a simple flat rate, the 3-year funds were offered at an interest rate averaging the interest rate in its main one-week refi operations over the next three years. That rate is currently at a record low of 1.0 percent. Banks have the option of paying back all or parts of the loans at any time after one year. Financial markets are watching to see how effectively governments use the time the ECB has given them to deliver growth and sustainable budgets. \"Without growth, the LTROs are a bridge to nowhere,\" said Andrew Bosomworth, senior portfolio manager at PIMCO.

A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success.[1] An AI\\'s intended utility function (or goal) can be simple (\"1 if the AI wins a game of Go, 0 otherwise\") or complex (\"Do mathematically similar actions to the ones succeeded in the past\"). Goals can be explicitly defined, or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others.[a] Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similarly to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[59] Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead of reason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[60] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.[61]AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.[b] A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following (optimal for first player) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe:[62]If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,take any empty square.Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate any function, including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world[citation needed]. These learners could therefore, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"combinatorial explosion\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad range of possibilities that are unlikely to be beneficial.[63][64] For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A* can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.[65]', '. Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a space flight simulation video game developed and published by Squad for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, with a Wii U version that was supposed to be released at a later date. The developers have stated that the gaming landscape has changed since that announcement and more details will be released soon. In the game, players direct a nascent space program, staffed and crewed by humanoid aliens known as \"Kerbals\". The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital maneuvers such as Hohmann transfer orbits and bi-elliptic transfer orbits.']\n"
